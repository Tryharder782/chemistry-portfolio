const statements = {
   intro: [
      `*Acids and bases* are extremely common, as are the reactions between acids and bases. The driving force is often the hydronium ion reacting with the hydroxide to form water.`
   ],

   explainTexture: [
      `At the macroscopic level, *acids* taste sour, may be damaging to the skin, and react with bases to yield salts. *Bases* taste bitter, feel slippery, and react with acids to form salts. But on a microscopic level there are various definitions by authors.`
   ],

   explainArrhenius: [
      `An *Arrhenius acid* is a substance that dissociates in water into hydrogen ions *(H^+^)* increasing the concentration of H^+^ ions in the solution. An *Arrhenius base* is a substance that dissociates in water into hydroxide *(OH^-^)* ions; increasing the concentration of OH^-^ ions in an aqueous solution (aq).`
   ],

   explainBronstedLowry: [
      `*The Bronsted-Lowry* definition states that acids are those with the ability to "donate" hydrogen ions *(H^+^)*, otherwise known as *protons*, and bases are those that "accept" them.`
   ],

   explainLewis: [
      `*The Lewis* definition defines a base (referred to as a Lewis base) to be a compound that can donate an *electron pair*, and an acid (a Lewis acid) to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.`
   ],

   explainSimpleDefinition: [
      `To put it simply, the presence of *H^+^* ions in a solution makes it acidic, while the presence of *OH^-^* makes it basic. Acids and bases are classified in strong and weak. This will depend on how much they can *dissociate* into H^+^ or OH^-^.`
   ],

   chooseStrongAcid: [
      `Strong acids are those that dissociate entirely into H^+^ ions. The reaction of these acids with water goes to completion.`,
      `*Choose a strong acid.*`
   ],

   showPhScale: [
      `That awesome colorful scale is a *pH scale!* You can see that [H^+^] and [OH^-^] are related to each other. When both are the same, they're both at *10^-7^ concentration*. At which point, *pH* is said to be neutral: 7. But what is pH?`
   ],

   explainPHConcept: [
      `*[H^+^]* presence in a solution can be very small, that's why the concept of *pH* exists. pH is defined as *pH=-log[H^+^]* and is used as a measurement of acidity of a solution. The same thing happens to *[OH^-^]*.`
   ],

   explainPOHConcept: [
      `*[OH^-^]* presence in a solution can be very small, that's the concept of *pOH* exists. pOH is defined as *pOH=-log[OH^-^]*. pOH is related with pH, as in every solution within water: *pH + pOH = 14*.`
   ],

   explainPRelation: [
      `The relation between pH and pOH can be easily seen in the pH scale. This relationship between *pH and pOH* will be better explained later. Just know that the lower the pH is, the more acidic the solution is. But why?`
   ],

   explainPConcentrationRelation1: [
      `If you take a look at the pH equation: *pH=-log[H^+^]*, the *[H^+^]* concentration is really small (10 to some negative exponent). The higher the exponent is, the smaller the value, making a high pH one that represents a low *[H^+^]*.`
   ],

   explainPConcentrationRelation2: [
      `In other words, you can notice that the higher the concentration of *[H^+^]*, then the lower pH is and the more acidic is the solution. The same thing goes for pOH and *[OH^-^]*. The higher pH is, the lower pOH is and vice versa.`
   ],

   chooseStrongBase: [
      `Strong bases are those that dissociate entirely into OH^-^ ions. The reaction of these bases with water goes to completion.`,
      `*Choose a strong base.*`
   ],

   chooseWeakAcid: [
      `Weak acids are those that dissociate partially into H^+^ ions. The reaction of these acids with water goes to equilibrium.`,
      `*Choose a weak acid.*`
   ],

   explainHEquivalence: [
      `*H_3_O^+^ and H^+^* ions are used interchangeably, they are the same thing, but one or the other is used for balancing convenience. In this case, for weak acids and bases, H_2_O is written as a reactant in the equations.`
   ],

   explainEquilibrium: [
      `As we already know now, equilibrium reactions will go towards the equilibrium state in which the concentrations of all species remain macroscopically constant. More of the acids-base equilibria will be explained later.`
   ],

   chooseWeakBase: [
      `Weak bases are those that dissociate partially into OH^-^ ions. The reaction of these bases with water goes to equilibrium.`,
      `*Choose a weak base.*`
   ],
