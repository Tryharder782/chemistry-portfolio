      `As stated before, weak acids and bases don't go to completion, as they do not dissociate entirely in water. In fact, they partially dissociate very little into *[H^+^]* or *[OH^-^]* ions. These are reactions that go toward equilibrium.`
   ],

   explainEquilibriumConstant1: [
      `In the equilibrium unit, we got to know about *reverse reactions*. A weak acid or base that dissociates in water is a reversible reaction as it goes to equilibrium. Do you remember *K*, the equilibrium constant?`
   ],

   explainEquilibriumConstant2: [
      `Let's refresh our memory! *K* is the value that relates products and reactants at equilibrium.`,
      `K is called *Ka* for an acid dissociating, and *Kb* for a base. *Choose a weak acid to learn more*.`
   ],

   explainHighKa: [
      `The larger K is, the larger the concentration of products at equilibrium is. This is why, when comparing weak acids, the one with a *higher Ka* is the one that at equilibrium will produce *more H^+^ ions*, making it more acidic.`
   ],

   explainKw: [
      `But there's also a *Kw*, for water. This is because water also dissociates, but very little H_2_O dissociates into H^+^ and OH^-^, making the equation for Kw: *Kw = [H^+^][OH^-^]*. *Kw* is constant, and at 25°C its value is *10^-14^*.`
   ],

   explainP14: [
      `And since OH^-^ and H^+^ dissociate equally from water, $[OH^-^] = [H^+^]$ and they're *10^-7^*. That's exactly why pH and pOH are both *7 in water*. When applying negative log to both sides of the equation *Kw = [H^+^][OH^-^]* we get that *14 = pH + pOH*.`
   ],

   explainKaKbNaming: [
      `For the purposes of this unit, *Ka* is usually called acid dissociation constant, *Kb* is called base dissociation constant and *Kw* is the water dissociation constant. Another way they relate to each other is by *Kw = Ka * Kb*.`
   ],

      `As Ka and Kb are really small, they get the same treatment and logarithms are used to better relate them:`,
      `*pKa = -log(Ka)*`,
      `*pKb = -log(Kb)*`

      `Buffers are solutions that resist a change in pH when acid or base is added to them. These are usually composed of a *weak acid* and its *conjugate base* or a *weak base* and its *conjugate acid.*`
   ],

   explainBufferSolutions2: [
      `Why is that? Well, when there's a weak acid in the solution, this would react with any *OH^-^* added, while its conjugate base would react with any *H^+^*, maintaining the *pH* relatively constant. The same thing happens with weak base buffers.`
   ],

   explainBufferUses: [
      `Buffers are very important and are present in *various systems*. For example, blood has a buffer system of bicarbonate and carbonic acid. It helps maintain blood at pH 7.4, and without it human life wouldn't be possible.`
   ],

   acidBufferLimitReached: [
      `Finally the *buffer* has reached its *limit!*. pH has gone down significantly now, but our buffer did a great job maintaining pH constant for that long! Let's try with weak bases now!`
   ],

   instructToChooseWeakBase: [
      `Let's try now with a weak base and see if we can make a buffer out of it!`,
      `*Choose a weak base to learn more.*`
   ],

   explainKbOhRelation: [
      `The larger K is, the larger the concentrations of products at equilibrium are. This is why, when comparing weak bases, the one with a *higher Kb* is the one that at equilibrium, will produce *more OH^-^ ions*, making it more basic.`
   ],

   instructToSetWaterLevelForBase: [
      `The *Henderson-Hasselbalch* equation has a very unique use to determine pH or pOH for buffers. First of all, let's set the water volume in the beaker.`,
