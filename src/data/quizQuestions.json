                "answer": "The buffering region is about 1 pH unit on either side of the pKa of the conjugate acid.",
                "explanation": "At the beginning of the titration there's only weak acid. When enough base reacts with it, it comes to a point where the concentration of the weak acid is equal to the concentration of its conjugate base, creating a buffer solution. At that point, $pH = pKa$, and 1 pH unit on either side of there it's called the buffering region."
